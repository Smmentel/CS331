# CS331  Computer Organization & Assembly Language
This course introduces low-level computer architecture and its relationship to assembly language
programming. Topics include number systems, Boolean algebra, logic gates, simplification of Boolean
functions, combinational logic, sequential logic, machine organization, assembly language programming, the
interface of low-level language to the architecture and higher-level programming languages, the
assembly/link/loading process, and machine representation of data/instructions.
Prerequisites: CS216
Goals:
Upon completing this course, the students will know about:
• Exhibit number systems problem-solving skills such as converting a number from binary to hex,
adding/subtracting numbers in two's complement systems.
• Demonstrate skills for tracing diagrams of simple logical circuits such as full adders and binary
counters.
• Understand the basics of the instruction set architecture of a specific processor (MIPS in the Winter
2023 class).
• Understand the datapath and control of a simple computer.
• Write programs in assembly language for simple arithmetic applications.
